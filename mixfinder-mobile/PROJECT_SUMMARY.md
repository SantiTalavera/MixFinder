- `scoring.test.ts`: Compatibility scoring tests

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Expo CLI
- Spotify Developer Account

### ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start development server: `npm start`

### 🔑 Environment Variables
```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
REDIRECT_URI=mixfinder://callback
VERCEL_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.vercel.app/callback
SCHEME=mixfinder
```

## 📊 Key Algorithms

### 🎯 Compatibility Scoring
The app calculates compatibility using multiple factors:
- **BPM Score**: Exact match (1.0), tolerance range (0.7-1.0), half/double time (0.8)
- **Key Score**: Same key (1.0), relative major/minor (0.8), adjacent keys (0.6)
- **Energy Score**: 1 - |energy1 - energy2|
- **Danceability Score**: 1 - |danceability1 - danceability2|
- **Genre Score**: Same genre (1.0), genre family (0.7), unrelated (0.3)

### 🎵 Track Ordering
Uses a greedy algorithm to maximize overall compatibility:
1. Start with base track
2. Find best compatible track from remaining candidates
3. Add to sequence and update compatibility scores
4. Repeat until all tracks are ordered

### 🎼 Camelot Wheel
Implements the industry-standard Camelot wheel:
- Maps Spotify keys (0-11) + mode (0=minor, 1=major) to Camelot notation
- Supports same key, adjacent keys, and relative major/minor matches
- Provides compatibility scoring for harmonic relationships

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **Authentication**: User connects with Spotify
2. **Search**: Find tracks by name, artist, or album
3. **Select Base Track**: Choose starting point for mix
4. **Configure**: Adjust BPM tolerance, harmonic matching, etc.
5. **Generate Suggestions**: Get compatible track recommendations
6. **Select Tracks**: Choose tracks for playlist
7. **Create Playlist**: Generate optimized playlist in Spotify
8. **Mix Guide**: Follow setup instructions for optimal mixing
